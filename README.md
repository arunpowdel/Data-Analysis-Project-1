# Emergency-Department-Patient-Crae-Analysis 

This repository contains Python code for analyzing patient data from the emergency department (ER) of a hospital. The dataset provides comprehensive details of patients' visits to the ER, including demographics, vital signs, complaints, diagnoses, and triage priorities. The analysis aims to provide insights into patient care, operational efficiency, and patterns in patient presentations, benefiting hospital administrators, medical practitioners, policymakers, and patients.

# Project Objectives
## Descriptive Analysis

    Determine average triage priority to understand case urgency.
    Analyze ER visit duration and changes after treatment for process efficiency assessment.
    Identify common transportation modes for patients arriving at the ER.
    Investigate frequent complaints and diagnoses to prepare for common medical issues.
    Analyze key vital sign metrics and identify outliers for patient prioritization.

## Clustering Analysis

    Cluster patients based on vital signs and triage priority to identify high-risk groups.
    Cluster patients based on complaints and diagnoses to understand common pathways through the ER.

## Predictive Analysis

    Predict triage priority using diagnosis descriptions and vital signs for faster decision-making.
    Identify presenting complaints associated with longer ER stays or higher triage priorities for resource optimization.
    Predict triage priority based on age, initial vital signs, and presenting complaints for accurate urgency assessment.
